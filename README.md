# Machine Learning and Deep learning Projects
This is a compilation of Machine Learning and Deep learning projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes.
It includes

## Machine Learning Alogrithms
1. Classification algorithms - KNN, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM
2. Sentiment Aanlysis - Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest
3. Collaborative filtering - Memory based, Model based ALS
4. Following algorithms implemented via AWS Sagemaker - Linear Learner, PCA, XGB, hyperparameter tuning

## Deep Learning Algorithms
1. Artificial Neural Network
2. Convolutional Neural Network
3. Recurrent Neural Network - LSTM
